# Dog-Breeds-Classification

Project Description:

Dogs breed classification is the task to predict the classes of the different breed, To do this InceptionV3 model has tried which is one of the transfer learning model. Trained only top layers and froze the other convolution layers. Also applied the image augmentation techniques to make the model generalized well.

Only 3500 images have been taken to build the pre-trained inceptionV3 module as the low computation power. Tried with the image augementation techniques to introduce the different samples to the model for it to be able to classify the classes well. 

Had used three sets of images to build and validate the models which we named train, Validation and test datasets. And Trained for 20 epochs and I have seen the gradually decreasing. I could have trained the model for more epochs or saved the weigths and start from the best weights by reducing the learning rate but I did not get into those steps.
